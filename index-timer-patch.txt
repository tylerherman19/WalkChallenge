TIMER FIX INSTRUCTIONS FOR index.html
==========================================

AUTOMATED FIX FAILED: File too large for API (68KB+)

MANUAL FIX REQUIRED:
1. Go to: https://github.com/tylerherman19/WalkChallenge/edit/main/index.html
2. Scroll to the VERY BOTTOM of the file
3. Look for the closing </body> tag
4. BEFORE the </body> tag, add this line:

   <script src="timer.js"></script>

5. Commit with message: "Add centralized timer to index.html"

This will load the timer.js file (already created and configured for April 1st 12:59 AM).

ALTERNATIVE: If index.html already has inline <script> with timer code:
- Find: var END = new Date('...');
- Replace with: var END = new Date('04/01/2026 00:59:59');

STATUS:
✅ submit-steps.html - Timer updated to April 1st 12:59 AM
✅ timer.js - Centralized timer created
⚠️ index.html - Needs script tag added (file too large for automated update)
